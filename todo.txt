Early stage potential TODO lists
- store notification message in DB [e.g sqlite] if the client socket is dead/offline
- handle persistent Session and Socket ID according to user id [just thought, not sure]
- setup with docker
- add various authentications
- handle for sending various data types like json, buffer, string
- custom unique event names
- add custom data encryption
- handle different websocket engines [just thought, not sure]
